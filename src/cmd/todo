next up:
- decompose every action into it's own async function in lib/ (but decompose loops into the main body)
- refactor the update and create actions into a single apply action and simpler function body (ID hasn't been supplied => create, otherwise update! no check if ID is wrong!)
- add "{get(w/table or JSON like before),update,delete} network-members --network-id <id> <member-id> --member-name --authorized" actions
- add withConfigCheck() and other HOCs
